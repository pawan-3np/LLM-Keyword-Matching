        - This is the *'Payoff Good Through Date'*, meaning the payoff amount is valid up to this date.

        - Choose the date that indicates the *final day up to which the quoted payoff amount or interest is valid*.
        - Do *not* select dates related to payment history, origination, or unrelated due dates.
